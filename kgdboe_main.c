/*
* A network interface for GDB for 3.x kernels.
* Inspired by the original 'kgdboe' by Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
* that seems abandoned as of 2014.
*
* (c) 2014 Sysprogs OU <sysprogs@sysprogs.com>
*
* Supported kernel versions: 3.8.x - 3.15.x
*
* Usage:
*	1. Build the module: make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd)
*   2. Load the module: insmod kgdboe.ko [device_name=ethX] [udp_port=Y]
*	3. Check the load status: dmesg | tail
*	4. Connect from gdb: target remote udp:<ip>:<port>
*
* WARNING! Using a network driver as a transport on multi-core systems is tricky! 
*		   KGDB does not fully know what spinlocks/resources the network driver needs
*		   and if another core has been stopped while holding them, the debugger will hang.
*		   This module does its best to avoid it by hooking resources that are likely required
*		   by the network driver, but there is no 100% guarantee that your driver does not take
*		   anything extra. It has been tested on the following network drivers:
*				pcnet32
*				e1000
*				r8169
*		   Nonetheless, by default it will disable all cores except #0 and will not do the hooking.
*		   If you absolutely need SMP while debugging, use the force_single_core=0 parameter to override,
*          but be ready to troubleshoot your network driver if it is different from the ones listed above.
